Computer Vision Lab Projects – OpenCV (Python)

This repository contains a collection of practical Computer Vision tasks implemented using Python and OpenCV in Jupyter Notebook. All implementations follow a structured lab-based workflow: loading images, processing, visualization, and saving outputs.

Implemented Modules
1. Basic Image Processing

Image loading and validation

BGR to RGB conversion

Grayscale conversion

Image resizing

Subplot visualization

Saving processed images

2. Image Quality Enhancer

Automatic brightness and contrast adjustment

Histogram-based clipping

Social-media optimized resizing (1080×1080)

3. Security Camera Grayscale Archiver

Conversion to grayscale for storage efficiency

Output saving and visualization

4. Image Similarity Comparison

Resizing for uniform comparison

MSE calculation

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

5. Color-Based Object Detection

HSV color space transformation

Red color masking

Highlighting detected regions

6. License Plate Privacy Protection

ROI selection
